This project analyzes network data using various graph theory techniques, including community detection, centrality analysis, and visualization. The analysis is done using Python's **NetworkX** library.

## Key Features:
- Community detection using the Louvain algorithm
- Graph visualization with **Matplotlib** and **NetworkX**
- Data preprocessing and analysis
